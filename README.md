# Big-Data-Project
The goal of this project was to build a Binary Classification model to predict employee attrition label as Yes or No. The dataset was taken from Kaggle website and had 34 features. 6 different models were used: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and Linear Support Vector Classifier. The models were compared based on their accuracy, confusion matrix and time taken to compute.  Tools and Programming Languages: Python, Jupyter notebook, Scala, Spark, AWS.
